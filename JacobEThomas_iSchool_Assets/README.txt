README

All of the code and data are in this box folder. I am uploading this during a storm and my upload speed very slow, so I was not able to push these files to github. All of the
code is in the jupyter notebooks, although some of the directory pathways to csv's were changed for organization. The most interesting documents are in the final data directory.

Also note, I am pulling all of th csv's out of this folder to facilitate a smoother upload. I will try to get a revised folder onto github after this storm passes.

Thank you,
Jacob
